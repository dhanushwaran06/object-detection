## Overview

This application demonstrates the power of machine learning in the browser. It captures live video from the webcam and uses the COCO-SSD model to detect and identify objects in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD
- Live video capture with `react-webcam`
- Dynamic rendering of detected objects with bounding boxes and labels
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and modern interface
- Loading indicator during model initialization

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev


1. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
